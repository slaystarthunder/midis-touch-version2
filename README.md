# midis-touch-version2

## Project Specification
Our program should generate one track with chords, and one track with melody. The chord and melody should be generated by a button after the following options have been set by the user:

1. Key
2. Tempo/BPM
3. Length in bars
   
After generation, the user can play and pause the song. When the song reaches its end it loops.

Users should have the ability to save the generated songs, locally and also on Firebase API. Users should have the ability to open saved songs, locally and from the Firebase API.

There should be a login screen with username and password, whereafter the user logs in if they have the correct password/username pair.

Chords are a collection of at least 3 tones played at the same time.
Melodies are a collection of tones that fit the notes of the chord.
Songs are a collection of chords and melodies.
